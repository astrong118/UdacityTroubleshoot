    "# Inference and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a trained network, you can use it for making predictions. This is typically called **inference**, a term borrowed from statistics. However, neural networks have a tendency to perform *too well* on the training data and aren't able to generalize to data that hasn't been seen before. This is called **overfitting** and it impairs inference performance. To test for overfitting while training, we measure the performance on data not in the training set called the **validation** set. We avoid overfitting through regularization such as dropout while monitoring the validation performance during training."

    "\n",
    "We are now going to load the Fashion-MNIST dataset using tensorflow_datasets as we've done before. In this case, however, we are going to define how to split the dataset ourselves. We are going to split the dataset such that 60\\% of the data will be used for training, 20\\% of the data will be used for validation, and the remaining 20\\% of the data will be used for testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we are going to do two things in succession. First we are going to combine (merge) the `train` and `test` splits. After the splits are merged into a single set, we are going to sub-split it into three sets, where the first set has 60\\% of the data, the second set has 20\\% of the data, and the third set has the remaining 20\\% of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To merge all the splits of a dataset together, we can use `split=tfds.Split.ALL`. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dataset = tfds.load('fashion_mnist', split=tfds.Split.ALL)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "will return a `dataset` that contains a single set with 70,000 examples. This is because the Fashion-MNIST dataset has a `train` split with 60,000 examples and a `test` split with 10,000 examples. The `tfds.Split.ALL` keyword merged both splits into a single set containing the combined data from both splits. \n",
    "\n",
    "After we have merged the splits into a single set, we need to sub-split it. We can sub-split our dataset by using the `.subsplit()` method. There are various ways in which we can use the `.subsplit()` method. Here we are going to sub-split the data by providing the percentage of data we want in each set. To do this we just pass a list with percentages we want in each set. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "split=tfds.Split.ALL.subsplit([60,20,20])\n",

    "will sub-split our dataset into three sets, where the first set has 60\\% of the data, the second set has 20\\% of the data, and the third set has the remaining 20\\% of the data. A word of **caution**, TensorFlow Datasets does not guarantee the reproducibility of the sub-split operations. That means, that two different users working on the same version of a dataset and using the same sub-split operations could end-up with two different sets of examples. Also, if a user regenerates the data, the sub-splits may no longer be the same. To learn more about `subsplit` and other ways to sub-split your data visit the [Split Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/splits#subsplit)."

    "If we look at the training and validation losses as we train the network, we can see a phenomenon known as overfitting. \n",

    "One way to prevent our model from overfitting is by stopping training when we achieve the lowest validation loss. If we take a look at the plots we can see that at the beginning of training the validation loss starts decreasing, then after some epochs it levels off, and then it just starts increasing. Therefore, we can stop training our model when the validation loss levels off, such that our network is accurate but it's not overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy is called **early-stopping**. We can implement early stopping in `tf.keras` by using a **callback**. A callback is a set of functions to be applied at given stages of the training process. You can pass a list of callbacks to the `.fit()` method by using the `callbacks` keyword argument. \n",
